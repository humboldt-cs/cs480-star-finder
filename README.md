## Overview
### Description
Star-Finder is an app that uses AR to allow the user to aim their phone in any direction (whether the sky or the ground) and see what stars 
and constellations are located in that direction. You can use it to see what is visible in the night sky, or aim your phone at the ground 
and see what constellations are on the other side of the planet.
